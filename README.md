# InvestmentProject_BNPParibas

Financial Analysis to model and estimate the expected returns of "Atlantic Lock-In Synthetic Zero" product (investment product of BNP Paribas) based on the FTSE 100 and the S&P 500 indices to investigate whether the product is worth to investment by comparing it to the risk-free money-market account. The model is based on the SDEs(Stochastic Differential Equations) with Brownian Motions. For the returns the stock prices of FTSE 100 and S&P 500 have been used. The model has been estimated with MLE(Maximum Likelihood Estimation) using Monte Carlo Simulation. As a result, we found that the probability of investing in the ”Atlantic Lock-In Synthetic Zero” will lead to higher return than investing solely in money-market account is 91.22%. Thus, the product is worth the investment.
